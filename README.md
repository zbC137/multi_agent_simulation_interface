## Installation and usage
This interface was built by Matlab App Designer and depends on the Matlab Runtime (V9.7).

In this repo, we offer two installers. The first one is "AppInstaller.exe", which demands the Runtime installed firstly. The second one is "AppInstaller_mcr.exe", where we have integrated the Runtime, therefore, you don't need to install the Runtime seperately.

For more details of installation, please refer to the "intallation.pdf".

For the usage instruction, please refer to the "App usage instruction.pdf".

Note that this interface can only be installed in Windows OS.

## Further development
We developed this interface by Matlab App Designer. If you want to add more functions to this interface, you can download this repo, and open the "multi_agent_simulation.mlapp" file in your Matlab, then you can make the changes as you want.

Please note the source codes of this repo were tested in Matlab R2019b. There might be some problems if you want to develop it in an ealier version of Matlab.
